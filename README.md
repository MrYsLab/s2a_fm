# A New Version For Python 3.5, called s2aio,  Is Available [Here](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s2aio/wiki).

Arduino users! Would you like to configure and control your Arduino micro-controller without having
to write a single line of Arduino sketch code and at the same time have access to a graphical user
interface?

Scratch and Snap! programmers! Would you like to control and communicate with an Arduino board using
Scratch? Imagine, using Scratch to control physical devices such as LEDs, motors, and relays while
monitoring devices, such as temperature sensors, potentiometers, and light sensors. What would you
create?

Want to do motor control using Snap! and Wifi? Check out our article on Physical Computing.
http://www.instructables.com/id/The-SnapMobile-Start-Your-Physical-Computing-Engin/

All the code is included here!

s2a_fm is a Scratch/Snap! hardware extension written in Python allowing Scratch or Snap! and an Arduino
micro-controller to communicate seamlessly.

Program Block translations are included for Chinese, Dutch, English (default), French, German, Greek, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Taiwanese.

Make sure you get the latest version of the Scratch Off-Line editor if you are using Scratch (version 404 or greater).
